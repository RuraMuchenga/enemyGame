## Introduction

This game is a simple project using Pygame, a Python library designed to write video games. The objective of the game is to move the player character to avoid falling enemies. As the game progresses, the speed of the falling enemies increases, making it more challenging.

## Features

- Player-controlled character using keyboard input
- Randomly spawning enemies
- Increasing difficulty over time
- Simple collision detection
- Score tracking

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-pygame-game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd simple-pygame-game
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game script:

    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

2. Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move the player character.

3. Avoid the falling enemies to keep playing. If you collide with an enemy, the game is over.

4. Your score will increase as you avoid more enemies. Try to beat your high score!

## Future Improvements

- Add multiple enemy types with different behaviors
- Introduce power-ups for the player
- Implement a start menu and game-over screen
- Add background music and sound effects
- High score saving and loading
